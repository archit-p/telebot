# ToDo-Fy Chatbot for Telegram
Ever feel the need for someone to store all your tasks for the day and remind you to complete them all without leaving your chat application?
ToDoFy can do all that for you. Just install the Flask script on a server and the program does the rest for you.

# Dependencies
1. Python - https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Python Pip - https://docs.python.org/3/installing/
2. Flask - pip install flask

# Setting up The Server
You'll need to have Apache Web Server installed on the server before you can set up the Flask app on it. 
      https://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi
Telegram requires the web server to have a domain name and have SSL certificates. More on that here:

       Free SSL certificates - https://letsencrypt.org/
